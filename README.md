### FaceIn is a web application which utilizes facial recognition to mark the attendance, time-in, and time-out of users. It has been built as the solution to Microsoft Engage Challenge 2022.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Agile Development Methodology

I followed Agile Development Methodology to complete the project. Agile is an easy to handle and flexible development process which relies on light(short-termed) planning procedures. It allows faster adjustments and reviewing with an aim of keeping the principle of zero bug bounce.
The complete task has been completed in 4 sprints, as depicted in the images below:

<img width="705" alt="agile-1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103529456/170895598-4d784122-8224-4639-afd3-0265091d049b.png">

<img width="707" alt="agile-2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103529456/170895600-ec5b5091-f144-49a1-9bea-ad1a6dd172c9.png">


<a id="getting-started"></a>
## üì¶ Getting Started/ Setup

1. Clone this repository.

```javascript
  git clone https://github.com/ansh25saini/FaceIn.git
```  

2. Make and activate the virtual environment *env*

```javascript
  python -m venv env
  env/Scripts/activate
```

3. Before installing requirements.txt, install cmake because without dlib cannot be installed and there will be a error, so, 

```javascript
   pip install cmake==3.22.4
```

4. After that install dlib==19.24.0
  
  ```javascript
   pip install dlib==19.24.0
  ```
  
5. After installing dlib and cmake, install rest,

  ```javascript
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

6. Do the following command one by one

  ```javascript
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
  ```
      
7. go to *env/Lib/site-packages/imutils/face_utils/facealigner.py* file and change the syntax of eyesCenter (in my file it is in 64th line)
  * from this
  ```javascript
   eyesCenter = ((leftEyeCenter[0] + rightEyeCenter[0]) // 2,
            (leftEyeCenter[1] + rightEyeCenter[1]) // 2)
  ```
  * to this
  ```javascript
  eyesCenter = (int((leftEyeCenter[0] + rightEyeCenter[0]) // 2),
            int((leftEyeCenter[1] + rightEyeCenter[1]) // 2)
  ```
  Make sure you follow *correct indentation* (of 2 spaces, as original one) 
  while  changing the above syntax; and finally save the file;

  Without the int keyword, *can't parse 'center'. Sequence item with index 0 has a wrong type*, error will be shown while taking images.

8. Finally to run the project,
  ```javascript
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

## üí° Challenges faced and learnings

- Spent several hours learning the MVT architecture of Django and Face Recognition Models and then began the design-build process of this project.
- Never implemented any ML model in a web application, so learnt about the same and implemenetd it.
- Came across a major fault in design:- presence of the register button on the home page. I realized that in this way any user, outside the organizaton can register, so changed the design. 
- Found a major error that app was recognizing and marking attendance of anybody (if the user was already registered) that was in the frame, even if the credentials were of different user. Changed the python code, so that only user whose has logged in can be marked.
- Learnt about PostgreSQL Database

<a id="scope"></a>
## üöß Limitations and Scope

* Limitations
   * Face recognition accuracy severly gets affected by brightness.- To counter this, many images of the individual are added in one go in real environment conditions and not just a single image, but certainly then also brightness has a role to play.
   * Training a dataset of a large number of users takes a very long time. Though training isn't something that needs to be done frequently, it would be better if a classifier taking less time while maintaining the accuracy can be built.
   * In this project 30 images of each employee are taken for better accuracy. 30 Images per employee in a larger organization can consume a massive volume to store the images.
* Scope
   * The training time can be reduced by retraining the classifier only for the newly added images.
   * A feature can be added where an employee is automatically sent a warning if his attendance or working hours are below the threshold.
   * Downloading attendance as csv file can be implemented.
