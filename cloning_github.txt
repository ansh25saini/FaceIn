In order to run the project on the local server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Github repository

2. Make virtual environment env:
                                python -m venv env 
                                   
3. Activate virtual environment env: 
                                   env/Scripts/activate

4. Before installing requirements.txt, install cmake because without it, dlib cannot be installed and there will be a error, so, 
                                                                                                                                pip install cmake==3.22.4

5. After that install dlib==19.24.0,
                                   pip install dlib==19.24.0

6. After installing dlib and cmake, install rest of the requirements:
                                                                    pip install -r requirements.txt

7. Do the following command one by one :
                                        python manage.py makemigrations

                                        python manage.py migrate

8. Before running the project, make sure to do a final change, go to 
     env/Lib/site-packages/imutils/facealigner.py file  
     and change the syntax of eyescenter (in my file it is in 64th line) 
     from :

        eyesCenter = ((leftEyeCenter[0] + rightEyeCenter[0]) // 2,
            (leftEyeCenter[1] + rightEyeCenter[1]) // 2)
 
to


        eyesCenter = (int((leftEyeCenter[0] + rightEyeCenter[0]) // 2),
                     int((leftEyeCenter[1] + rightEyeCenter[1]) // 2))

##Make sure you follow correct indentation (of 2 spaces, as original one) 
while  changing the above syntax; and finally save the file;                              

Without the int keyword,   can't parse 'center'. Sequence item with index 0 has a wrong type, error will be shown while taking images.

9. Finally to run the project,
                              python manage.py runserver
